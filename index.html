  <h1>Basic Accounting Concepts</h1>

  <p>
    Accounting is the **language of business**. It involves recording, classifying, summarizing, and interpreting
    financial transactions. This page provides a very basic overview of core accounting elements.
  </p>

  <h2>The Accounting Equation</h2>
  <p>
    The foundation of double-entry accounting is the **Accounting Equation**, which must always remain in balance.
  </p>

  <p>
    **Assets = Liabilities + Equity**
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>**Assets:** Resources owned by a business (e.g., Cash, Accounts Receivable, Equipment).</li>
    <li>**Liabilities:** Obligations of a business to outside parties (e.g., Accounts Payable, Loans Payable).</li>
    <li>**Equity (Owner's/Stockholder's):** The owner's residual claim on the assets after deducting liabilities.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common Account Types</h2>

  <p>
    Financial transactions are recorded into different accounts. These accounts are often classified into five main
    types:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Assets</li>
    <li>Liabilities</li>
    <li>Equity</li>
    <li>Revenue (Increases Equity)</li>
    <li>Expenses (Decreases Equity)</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Example Balance Sheet Elements</h2>

  <p>
    The Balance Sheet is a snapshot of a company's assets, liabilities, and equity at a specific point in time. Below
    are examples of accounts that might appear.
  </p>

  <table border="1" class="balancesheet-account">
